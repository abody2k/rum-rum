# RumRum

This is a project that enables random people to make new rooms that can be private or public and join strangers in random voice/video calls and chatting as well. It leverages the use of WebRTC and public STUN servers.

in case the communication fails it means one or both of the users are behind NAT and there has to be a TURN server which basically works as relay

## Development server

```bash
ng serve

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
